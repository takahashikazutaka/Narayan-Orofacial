@article{taka2011humanbetawave,
abstract = {Previous studies in non-human primates have shown that beta oscillations (15-30Hz) of local field potentials (LFPs) in the arm/hand areas of primary motor cortex (MI) propagate as traveling waves across the cortex. These waves exhibited two stereotypical features across animals and tasks: 1) The waves propagated in two dominant modal directions roughly 180 degrees apart, and 2) their propagation speed ranged from 10 \~{} 35 cm/s. It is, however, unknown if such cortical waves occur in the human motor cortex. This study shows that the two properties of propagating beta waves are present in MI of a tetraplegic human patient while he was instructed to perform an instruction delay center out task using a cursor controlled by the chin. Moreover, we show that beta waves are sustained and have similar properties whether the subject was engaged in the task or at rest. The directions of the successive sustained waves both in the human subject and a nonhuman primate (NHP) subject tended to switch from one dominant mode to the other, and at least in the NHP subject the estimated distance travelled between successive waves traveling into and out of the central sulcus is consistent with the hypothesis of wave reflection between the border of motor and somatosensory cortices. Further, we show that the occurrence of the beta waves is not uniquely tied to periods of increased power in the beta frequency band. These results demonstrate that traveling beta waves in MI are a general phenomenon occurring in human as well as non-human primates. Consistent with the non-human primate data, the dominant directions of the beta LFP waves in human aligned to the proximal to distal gradient of joint representations in MI somatotopy. This consistent finding of wave propagation may imply the existence of a hardwired organization of motor cortex that mediates this spatio-temporal pattern.},

@article{doug2006betawave,
abstract = {High-frequency oscillations in the beta range (10-45 Hz) are most active in motor cortex during motor preparation and are postulated to reflect the steady postural state or global attentive state of the animal. By simultaneously recording multiple local field potential signals across the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) trained to perform an instructed-delay reaching task, we found that these oscillations propagated as waves across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex. Moreover, we found that information about the visual target to be reached was encoded in terms of both latency and amplitude of evoked waves at a time when the field phase-locked with respect to the target onset. These findings suggest that high-frequency oscillations may subserve intra- and inter-cortical information transfer during movement preparation and execution.},

Recently, the location of the neural generators involved in increasing power within the beta (15‚Äì30¬†Hz) frequency band following movement (post-movement beta rebound, PMBR) has come into question [Parkes, L.M, Bastiaansen, M.C.M, Norris, D.G., 2006. Combining \{EEG\} and fMRI to investigate the post-movement beta rebound. NeuroImage 29, 685‚Äì696.]. We used the synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) spatial filtering method to identify the time course and location of oscillatory changes within the beta and mu (8‚Äì14¬†Hz) frequency bands during the performance of voluntary movements. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded from 10 adult subjects during abduction of the right index finger. Changes in beta and mu source power were calculated for periods during and following movement, relative to pre-movement baseline activity. Decreases in beta band activity (event-related desynchronization, ERD) were observed during movement, with a strong increase (PMBR) beginning 230&#xa0;¬±&#xa0;170¬†ms following movement, lasting for 680&#xa0;¬±&#xa0;170¬†ms. Mu band \{ERD\} was observed both during and following movement, with little to no post-movement rebound. Beta and mu \{ERD\} were localized bilaterally to the hand region of postcentral gyrus whereas \{PMBR\} was localized bilaterally to the hand region of precentral gyrus (motor cortex). Both \{PMBR\} and beta \{ERD\} were strongest contralateral to the side of movement. These results provide further evidence that movement influences independent cortical rhythms in sensorimotor areas, and confirm previous reports of precentral generators of \{PMBR\} in the region of motor cortex, with postcentral generators of beta and mu \{ERD\} during movement.

We find that for an appropriate recurrence rate ( R R &gt; 0.02 ) the influence of noise on C can be minimized while L is independent of \{RR\} for increasing levels of noise. Indications of structural complexity were found for healthy EEG, but to a lesser extent than epileptic EEG. Furthermore, C performed better than L in case of epileptic EEG. Our results show that \{RN\} measures can provide insights into the structural properties of \{EEG\} in normal and pathological states. "

abstract = {Visually guided reaching movements by monkeys has become an important paradigm for examining the function of various sensory and motor areas of the brain. However, a major problem with interpreting neural discharge during this motor task has been the difficulty to quantify and manipulate the mechanics of movement. To address this problem, a new experimental facility has been developed to allow neural recordings in a monkey while it makes movements with a mechanical linkage attached to its arm. The device (KINARM) has hinge joints aligned with the monkey's shoulder and elbow and allows the monkey to make arm movements in the horizontal plane. Custom-made fibreglass braces attach the linkage to the monkey's forearm and arm. Motors attached to the mechanical linkage provide angular position of the joints and apply torques either to the shoulder or elbow, or both. The KINARM is used in concert with a computer projection system that provides virtual targets in the plane of the arm. Preliminary results illustrate the ability of a monkey to perform a variety of multi-joint motor tasks under various static and dynamic loads.},

We investigated how incorporating information about state can improve the performance of a decoder. Unit spiking activity and LFPs were recorded from chronically implanted electrode arrays in primary motor and premotor corticies while a monkey performed a reach to grasp task. We applied an unsupervised clustering technique to LFP data to identify different neural states. Then, for each state, we fit a sparse Bayesian linear model with causal interaction terms to decode the joint kinematics of many degrees of freedom in the arm and hand. We used automatic relevance determination for variable selection and to avoid overfitting. We show that the state-based decoding model improves decoding performance over a model without state information. We further show that topology of interaction terms is different across different states.},

abstract ={Mammals chew more rhythmically than lepidosaurs. The research presented here evaluated possible reasons for this difference in relation to differences between lepidosaurs and mammals in sensorimotor systems. Variance in the absolute and relative durations of the phases of the gape cycle was calculated from kinematic data from four species of primates and eight species of lepidosaurs. The primates exhibit less variance in the duration of the gape cycle than in the durations of the four phases making up the gape cycle. This suggests that increases in the durations of some gape cycle phases are accompanied by decreases in others. Similar effects are much less pronounced in the lepidosaurs. In addition, the primates show isometric changes in gape cycle phase durations, i.e. the relative durations of the phases of the gape cycle change little with increasing cycle time. In contrast, in the lepidosaurs variance in total gape cycle duration is associated with increases in the proportion of the cycle made up by the slow open phase. We hypothesize that in mammals the central nervous system includes a representation of the optimal chew cycle duration maintained using afferent feedback about the ongoing state of the chew cycle. The differences between lepidosaurs and primates do not lie in the nature of the sensory information collected and its feedback to the feeding system, but rather the processing of that information by the CNS and its use feed-forward for modulating jaw movements and gape cycle phase durations during chewing.},

abstract = {The brain mechanisms underlying mastication are not fully understood. To address this issue, we analyzed the distribution patterns of cortico-striatal and cortico-brainstem axon terminals and the origin of thalamocortical and intracortical fibers by injecting anterograde/retrograde tracers into physiologically and morphologically defined jaw movement-related cortical areas. Four areas were identified in the macaque monkey: the primary and supplementary orofacial motor areas (MIoro and SMAoro) and the principal and deep parts of the cortical masticatory area (CMaAp and CMaAd), where intracortical microstimulation produced single twitch-like or rhythmic jaw movements, respectively. Tracer injections into these areas labeled terminals in the ipsilateral putamen in a topographic fashion (MIoro vs. SMAoro and CMaAp vs. CMaAd), in the lateral reticular formation and trigeminal sensory nuclei contralaterally (MIoro and CMaAp) or bilaterally (SMAoro) in a complex manner of segregation vs. overlap, and in the medial parabranchial and K\"{o}lliker-Fuse nuclei contralaterally (CMaAd). The MIoro and CMaAp received thalamic projections from the ventrolateral and ventroposterolateral nuclei, the SMAoro from the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei, and the CMaAd from the ventroposteromedial nucleus. The MIoro, SMAoro, CMaAp, and CMaAd received intracortical projections from the ventral premotor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex, the ventral premotor cortex and rostral cingulate motor area, the ventral premotor cortex and area 7b, and various sensory areas. In addition, the MIoro and CMaAp received projections from the three other jaw movement-related areas. Our results suggest that the four jaw movement-related cortical areas may play important roles in the formation of distinctive masticatory patterns.},

abstract ={Variation in the form of masticatory cycles in individuals is often assumed to be limited. The contrary hypothesis, that jaw cycles vary widely but systematically with food consistency, was tested in macaques fed similar-sized pieces of monkey chow, apple, and banana. With the animals under general anesthesia, radiopaque markers were inserted into the jaw, tongue, and hyoid. Oral movements were recorded by cineradiography at 100 frames/sec in lateral projection synchronously with frontal view cinephotography (50 frames/sec). The films were examined for the events that subdivide each jaw movement cycle into its constituent phases (fast closing, slow closing, intercuspal, slow or early opening, final opening). The frame numbers at which these events occurred were used to define phase durations. The numbers of cycles preceding a swallow increased with the hardness of the ingested food item. Regardless of the test food, every feeding sequence (initial ingestion to final clearance of mouth) contained multiple swallows, each of which defined the end of a sub-sequence. When the animals were feeding on chow, the sub-sequences were initially long (20 cycles or more), but when they were feeding on banana, the sub-sequences were short (10 cycles or fewer). Although the form of individual cycles (defined by phase durations) was often unrelated to that of neighboring cycles, the general cycle characteristics in a sub-sequence typified a particular food. Chow feeding cycles were characterized by slow-closing (SC) phases of long duration with slow-opening (SO) phases of short duration; the characteristics of banana feeding cycles were the reverse. SC duration correlated directly and SO duration correlated inversely with food hardness (p < 0.001). The evidence supports the view that the centrally generated pattern of movement is highly dependent upon intra-oral sensory feedback.},

To quantify the impact of food material properties on temporal and spatial variables of chewing kinematics at the level of the feeding sequence, gape cycle, and gape cycle phases.
Design
Three-dimensional kinematics were quantified from two adult, male capuchin monkeys (genus Cebus) while chewing on foods grouped by material properties into two categories, foods of high toughness and foods of low toughness.
Results
Total sequence duration and the total number of chews in a sequence are significantly influenced by food material properties, with foods of high toughness having shorter sequence durations and lower total chew numbers per sequence. Mean cycle duration is not impacted by food material properties at the level of the sequence, but food group differences are found when each cycle is compared independently by food group. Prior to chew fifteen, foods of low toughness elicit significantly lower gape cycle durations and significantly lower vertical displacements of M1. At the level of the chew phase, variance in slow close explains the majority of variance in chew cycle duration prior to chew thirteen, with foods of low toughness eliciting shorter slow close durations and smaller vertical displacements of M1. The vertical displacement of M1 throughout the chewing sequence is the primary spatial determinant of variance in the duration of slow close.
Conclusions
These data reveal that chewing behaviour in Cebus is temporally stereotyped at the level of the gape cycle, but temporally and spatially flexible within the cycle, at least partly due to central mechanisms of motor control."

volume = {51},
number = {2},
pages = {307-319},
year = {2011},
abstract ={Chewing kinematics reflects interactions between centrally generated motor signals and peripheral sensory feedback from the constantly changing oral environment. Chewing is a strongly modulated behavior that responds to differences in material properties among different type of foods and to changes in the external physical properties of the food as the bolus gets processed. Feeding, as any complex biological behavior, presents variation at multiple hierarchical levels, from among species or higher-order levels to variation among chewing cycles within a single feeding sequence. Thus, to understand the mechanics and evolution of feeding systems requires estimation of how this variation is distributed across each of these hierarchical levels, which in turn requires large sample sizes. The development of affordable, high-resolution, three-dimensional kinematic recording systems has increased our ability to collect large amounts of data on complete or near-complete feeding sequences that can be used to shed light on the mechanisms of control in vertebrate feeding. In this study, we present data on the nature and sources of variation (from species to chewing cycle levels) in kinematics of chewing in two species of primates, Cebus and Macaca, while they feed on foods of known material properties. Variation in chewing kinematics was not evenly distributed among hierarchical levels. Most of the variation was observed among chewing cycles, most likely in response to changes in the external properties of the food bolus throughout the feeding sequence. Species differences were found in duration and vertical displacement during slow-close phase suggesting that each species exhibits different power stroke dynamics. Cebus exhibited more variable gape cycles than did Macaca, in particular when eating low-toughness foods. This increased ability to temporally and spatially modulate the gape cycle may reflect increased efficiency in processing food because Cebus monkeys use fewer, but longer cycles, than does Macaca when feeding on low-toughness foods. This is due to an increase in duration of the jaw-opening phases of the gape cycle, when the tongue repositions the food bolus in the oral cavity.},

abstract = {Brain circuitry processes information by rapidly and selectively engaging functional neuronal networks. The dynamic formation of networks is often evident in rhythmically synchronized neuronal activity and tightly correlates with perceptual, cognitive and motor performances. But how synchronized neuronal activity contributes to network formation and how it relates to the computation of behaviorally relevant information has remained difficult to discern. Here we structure recent empirical advances that link synchronized activity to the activation of so-called dynamic circuit motifs. These motifs explicitly relate (1) synaptic and cellular properties of circuits to (2) identified timescales of rhythmic activation and to (3) canonical circuit computations implemented by rhythmically synchronized circuits. We survey the ubiquitous evidence of specific cell and circuit properties underlying synchronized activity across theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands and show that their activation likely implements gain control, context-dependent gating and state-specific integration of synaptic inputs. This evidence gives rise to the dynamic circuit motifs hypothesis of synchronized activation states, with its core assertion that activation states are linked to uniquely identifiable local circuit structures that are recruited during the formation of functional networks to perform specific computational operations.},

abstract = {An important part of the cortical processing of swallowing takes place in the sensorimotor cortex, predominantly in the left hemisphere. However, until now, only deglutition related brain activation with low time resolution exceeding a time interval of 1 s has been reported. In this study, we have examined the chronological sequence of cortical swallowing processing in humans by means of high temporal resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG). The cortical MEG activity was recorded during self-paced volitional swallowing in 10 healthy subjects. Data were analyzed using synthetic aperture magnetometry and the group analysis was performed using a permutation test. Swallowing-related muscle activity was recorded by electromyography. Within the time interval of 1 s of the most pronounced muscular swallowing execution, the MEG analysis revealed neural activation in the primary sensorimotor cortex. During the first 600 ms, only left hemispheric activation was found, bihemispheric activation during the next 200 ms and a right hemispheric activation during the last 200 ms. Thus, our results demonstrate a time-dependent shift of neural activation from left to right sensorimotor cortex during deglutition with left hemispheric dominance in the early stage of volitional swallowing and right hemispheric dominance during its later part.

@article{taka2011humanbetawave,
abstract = {Previous studies in non-human primates have shown that beta oscillations (15-30Hz) of local field potentials (LFPs) in the arm/hand areas of primary motor cortex (MI) propagate as traveling waves across the cortex. These waves exhibited two stereotypical features across animals and tasks: 1) The waves propagated in two dominant modal directions roughly 180 degrees apart, and 2) their propagation speed ranged from 10 \~{} 35 cm/s. It is, however, unknown if such cortical waves occur in the human motor cortex. This study shows that the two properties of propagating beta waves are present in MI of a tetraplegic human patient while he was instructed to perform an instruction delay center out task using a cursor controlled by the chin. Moreover, we show that beta waves are sustained and have similar properties whether the subject was engaged in the task or at rest. The directions of the successive sustained waves both in the human subject and a nonhuman primate (NHP) subject tended to switch from one dominant mode to the other, and at least in the NHP subject the estimated distance travelled between successive waves traveling into and out of the central sulcus is consistent with the hypothesis of wave reflection between the border of motor and somatosensory cortices. Further, we show that the occurrence of the beta waves is not uniquely tied to periods of increased power in the beta frequency band. These results demonstrate that traveling beta waves in MI are a general phenomenon occurring in human as well as non-human primates. Consistent with the non-human primate data, the dominant directions of the beta LFP waves in human aligned to the proximal to distal gradient of joint representations in MI somatotopy. This consistent finding of wave propagation may imply the existence of a hardwired organization of motor cortex that mediates this spatio-temporal pattern.},

Moreover, we found that information about the visual target to be reached was encoded in terms of both latency and amplitude of evoked waves at a time when the field phase-locked with respect to the target onset.

The event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha band and beta rhythms can be seen as a correlate of an activated cortical area with an increased excitability level of neurons. An event-related synchronization (ERS) of frequency components between 10 and 13 Hz may represent a deactivated cortical area or inhibited cortical network, at least under certain circumstances. It is hypothesized, that antagonistic ERD/ERS patterns, called ‚Äòfocal ERD/surround ERS‚Äô, may reflect a thalamo-cortical mechanism to enhance focal cortical activation by simultaneous inhibition of other cortical areas. Induced oscillations in the beta band (13‚Äì35 Hz, beta ERS) were found in sensorimotor areas after voluntary movement and after somatosensory stimulation. This may be interpreted as a state of ‚Äòinhibition‚Äô of neural circuitry in the primary motor cortex. Simultaneous activation of the motor cortex by e.g. motor imagery lead to an attenuation of the beta ERS. Moreover, there is evidence that the frequency of the induced beta oscillations represent a ‚Äòresonance-like frequency‚Äô of underlying cortical networks. However, further research is needed to investigate the functional meaning of bursts of beta oscillations below 35 Hz. "

abstract = "Voluntary movements are accompanied by amplitude changes in cortical rhythms presumably as a result of functional activation of sensorimotor areas. Recently, the location of the neural generators involved in increasing power within the beta (15‚Äì30¬†Hz) frequency band following movement (post-movement beta rebound, PMBR) has come into question [Parkes, L.M, Bastiaansen, M.C.M, Norris, D.G., 2006. Combining \{EEG\} and fMRI to investigate the post-movement beta rebound. NeuroImage 29, 685‚Äì696.]. We used the synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) spatial filtering method to identify the time course and location of oscillatory changes within the beta and mu (8‚Äì14¬†Hz) frequency bands during the performance of voluntary movements. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded from 10 adult subjects during abduction of the right index finger. Changes in beta and mu source power were calculated for periods during and following movement, relative to pre-movement baseline activity. Decreases in beta band activity (event-related desynchronization, ERD) were observed during movement, with a strong increase (PMBR) beginning 230&#xa0;¬±&#xa0;170¬†ms following movement, lasting for 680&#xa0;¬±&#xa0;170¬†ms. Mu band \{ERD\} was observed both during and following movement, with little to no post-movement rebound. Beta and mu \{ERD\} were localized bilaterally to the hand region of postcentral gyrus whereas \{PMBR\} was localized bilaterally to the hand region of precentral gyrus (motor cortex). Both \{PMBR\} and beta \{ERD\} were strongest contralateral to the side of movement. These results provide further evidence that movement influences independent cortical rhythms in sensorimotor areas, and confirm previous reports of precentral generators of \{PMBR\} in the region of motor cortex, with postcentral generators of beta and mu \{ERD\} during movement.

The event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha band and beta rhythms can be seen as a correlate of an activated cortical area with an increased excitability level of neurons. An event-related synchronization (ERS) of frequency components between 10 and 13 Hz may represent a deactivated cortical area or inhibited cortical network, at least under certain circumstances. It is hypothesized, that antagonistic ERD/ERS patterns, called ‚Äòfocal ERD/surround ERS‚Äô, may reflect a thalamo-cortical mechanism to enhance focal cortical activation by simultaneous inhibition of other cortical areas. Induced oscillations in the beta band (13‚Äì35 Hz, beta ERS) were found in sensorimotor areas after voluntary movement and after somatosensory stimulation.

We find that for an appropriate recurrence rate ( R R &gt; 0.02 ) the influence of noise on C can be minimized while L is independent of \{RR\} for increasing levels of noise. Indications of structural complexity were found for healthy EEG, but to a lesser extent than epileptic EEG. Furthermore, C performed better than L in case of epileptic EEG. Our results show that \{RN\} measures can provide insights into the structural properties of \{EEG\} in normal and pathological states. "

abstract = {Visually guided reaching movements by monkeys has become an important paradigm for examining the function of various sensory and motor areas of the brain. However, a major problem with interpreting neural discharge during this motor task has been the difficulty to quantify and manipulate the mechanics of movement. To address this problem, a new experimental facility has been developed to allow neural recordings in a monkey while it makes movements with a mechanical linkage attached to its arm. The device (KINARM) has hinge joints aligned with the monkey's shoulder and elbow and allows the monkey to make arm movements in the horizontal plane. Custom-made fibreglass braces attach the linkage to the monkey's forearm and arm. Motors attached to the mechanical linkage provide angular position of the joints and apply torques either to the shoulder or elbow, or both. The KINARM is used in concert with a computer projection system that provides virtual targets in the plane of the arm. Preliminary results illustrate the ability of a monkey to perform a variety of multi-joint motor tasks under various static and dynamic loads.},

abstract={Many current brain-machine interfaces do not consider the behavioral context of the subject, rather, they assume the subject is constantly engaged in a single task. We investigated how incorporating information about state can improve the performance of a decoder. Unit spiking activity and LFPs were recorded from chronically implanted electrode arrays in primary motor and premotor corticies while a monkey performed a reach to grasp task. We applied an unsupervised clustering technique to LFP data to identify different neural states. Then, for each state, we fit a sparse Bayesian linear model with causal interaction terms to decode the joint kinematics of many degrees of freedom in the arm and hand. We used automatic relevance determination for variable selection and to avoid overfitting. We show that the state-based decoding model improves decoding performance over a model without state information. We further show that topology of interaction terms is different across different states.},
